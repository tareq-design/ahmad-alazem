JWT Strategy
Payload offers the ability to Authenticate via JSON Web Tokens (JWT). These can be read from the responses of login, logout, refresh, and me auth operations.

Tip: You can access the logged-in user from within Access Control and Hooks through the req.user argument. More details.

Identifying Users Via The Authorization Header
In addition to authenticating via an HTTP-only cookie, you can also identify users via the Authorization header on an HTTP request.

Example:

const user = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'dev@payloadcms.com',
    password: 'password',
  }),
}).then((req) => await req.json())

const request = await fetch('http://localhost:3000', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `JWT ${user.token}`,
  },
})
Omitting The Token
In some cases you may want to prevent the token from being returned from the auth operations. You can do that by setting removeTokenFromResponses to true like so:

import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const UsersWithoutJWTs: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'users-without-jwts',
  auth: {
    removeTokenFromResponses: true, 
  },
}
External JWT Validation
When validating Payload-generated JWT tokens in external services, use the processed secret rather than your original secret key:

import crypto from 'node:crypto'

const secret = crypto
  .createHash('sha256')
  .update(process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET)
  .digest('hex')
  .slice(0, 32)
Note: Payload processes your secret using SHA-256 hash and takes the first 32 characters. This processed value is what's used for JWT operations, not your original secret.
